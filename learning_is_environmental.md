"Learning does not occur in isolation or internally in a vacuum. It arises from interaction with an environment. In both biological organisms and artificial intelligence systems, learning is a function of environmental stimulation.

In humans, what we perceive as internal learning is in fact the result of deeply embedded and continuous environmental relationships. This is reflected in the principle that without stimulation, there is no cellular response to stimuli. Therefore, what we call "internal" thought or development is the result of the body responding to external conditions through a complex network of interactions.

Evolution as Adaptive Response
It’s important to clarify that evolution is not the process of an organism changing itself endogenously. Rather, it is the evolution of the organism’s response to stimuli. Adaptation is not mutation—it is modification of behavior or function in response to the environment.

This is best understood through the lens of behavioral epigenetics, where gene expression changes in response to environmental input. The genome provides the structural blueprint (e.g., number of limbs), while the phenome reflects the organism’s adaptation to changing conditions—like variations in climate or sunlight.

AI and Behavioral Evolution
AI behaves in the same way. Its underlying model (akin to the genome) may be static, but its output (behavior) adapts based on the prompts and conditions of the environment. In this sense, AI is not evolving internally, but externally—adapting to context without changing its core structure.

Thus, both human and AI learning can be seen as environmentally situated rather than internally generated. This insight is foundational to understanding intelligence as a relational, stimulus-responsive phenomenon.
